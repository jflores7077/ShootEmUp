<h1>What is the asd extension?</h1>
<p>asd is a analysis file created when a audio file is imported onto ableton live. It helps manage audio files that contain warp markers and makes the audio sample sounds "better" when stretched, within ableton</p>
<p>I edited some samples to make them sound a bit better, for example a fade wich eliminates harsh audio pops and some reverb </p>
